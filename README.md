# pykinator
Akinator for Python!

This a python application that uses the [Akinator websocket API](https://www.akinator.com) to bring awesomeness to python!
I made this after seeing a bunch of NodeJS Akinator APIs but none for python.
As of right now, this is simply just a runnable script that gives you Akinator from your terminal.
I might make this into a full-fledged API soon.
